# Portfolio
Portfolio website and cross platform application

**index.dart** - This file is to hold all my packages, which are required in other classes. I have imported this ONE file in all my other classes and widgets.

Folders and their roles:

**screens** - This folder contains the screens which will be configured in the routes in the main.dart file.

**providers** - I’m using provider pattern for this application for state management, so all the provider files goes to the providers folder with the file naming convention “user_provider.dart” as an example.

**models** - Providers will use these models, sort of mapped with my entity in database.

**services** - This folder is for backend operation like connecting to the Firestore or invoking HTTP calls etc.

**utilities** - All the common items goes in here, example., constants used in the project.
